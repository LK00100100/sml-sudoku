A 6-number mini sudoku solver made with SML/NJ. Made for Stony Brook's CSE 307 class with Professor Fodor in 2015.
This solver will take a few minutes since it's just pure brute force.

# Setup
Go to the SML/NJ website. Download the software for your system. Run sml on your program

```
sml ./yourprogram.sml

You can change the sudoku inputs by opening the sudoku file, scrolling all the way down, and changing the inputs to the solve function.
~1 is "an empty space." 

If the board is unsolvable, it returns the same input.
